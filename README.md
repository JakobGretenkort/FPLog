# FPLog
FPLog is a system to check if websites are using browser fingerprinting and to log exactly the fingerprinting related access patterns the website exhibits.

# Setup

TODO: Which version, how?

## Configure Build

## Configure Firefox
Go to `about:config` and set `security.sandbox.content.level` to `1`.
This will allow the browser modifications to write logfiles.
